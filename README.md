# Blood_cell_segmentation_with_Unet

## Overview
For thyroid cancer and many other types of cancer, processes such as fine needle aspiration cytology and cytoreductive testing are essential. Cancer is diagnosed by looking at the cells. Artificial intelligence can be added to this process to bring convenience and speed to diagnosis. In addition, cell segmentation is important for the detection and classification of tumor or disease cells in the context of pathological tissue examination. The segmentation of cancer tissue helps in the development of cancer diagnosis and treatment. 

Medical AI should be reliable by ensuring that the process of deriving results is differentiated and transparent. To make the thyroid cancer diagnosis model reliable, we identify the distribution and number of cancer cells. For this purpose, we tried cell segmentation with various architectures based on Unet. After creating a mask, we use OpenCV's watershed function to identify the number and distribution.

Our thyroid cancer data does not have an annotation image. Therefore, we will utilize similar data to create a mask generation model for our data. Also, the thyroid cancer data is restricted data belonging to our project and cannot be released to the public. Attach a picture of the experiment, replacing it with any image from the @@paper that is most similar to our data.

## Dataset source
A total of 2656 images are available. 1328 Original blood cell images with 1328 corresponding ground truths. Out of that, Jeet B Lahiri separated the training and testing sets with 1169 images and 159 images respectively.
Data gernerate by Deponker, Sarker Depto, Shazidur Rahman, Md. Mekayel Hosen, Mst Shapna Akter, Tamanna Rahman Reme, Aimon Rahman, Hasib Zunai, M. Sohel Rahman and M.R.C.Mahdy

#### Short Description
With the advent of deep learing algorithms in medial domain, there is a need for quality and large datasets. In this work, we introduced the largest microscopic blood cell segmentation dataset and benchmark different state-of-the-art algorithms on it. Our findings and contributions are particularly helpful for researchers working in deep learning with applications in medial domain.

## Result

### Unet_grayscale & ResUnet_grayscale
We can see in the traning history that Unet_grayscale is being overfitted. The same is true for RGB.

For ResUnet, we noticed an exploding gradient in the loss value at certain epochs. We determined that the learning rate was too high to reach a local minimum.

So we experimented by adding different models, schedulers, and early stopping.
