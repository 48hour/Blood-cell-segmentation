# Thyroid_cell_segmentation_and_Count_with_Unet_n_OpenCV

## Overview
For thyroid cancer and many other types of cancer, processes such as fine needle aspiration cytology and cytoreductive testing are essential. Cancer is diagnosed by looking at the cells. Artificial intelligence can be added to this process to bring convenience and speed to diagnosis. In addition, cell segmentation is important for the detection and classification of tumor or disease cells in the context of pathological tissue examination. The segmentation of cancer tissue helps in the development of cancer diagnosis and treatment. 

Medical AI should be reliable by ensuring that the process of deriving results is differentiated and transparent. To make the thyroid cancer diagnosis model reliable, we identify the distribution and number of cancer cells. For this purpose, we tried cell segmentation with various architectures based on Unet. After creating a mask, we use OpenCV's watershed function to identify the number and distribution.

Our thyroid cancer data does not have an annotation image. Therefore, we will utilize similar data to create a mask generation model for our data. Also, the thyroid cancer data is restricted data belonging to our project and cannot be released to the public. Attach a picture of the experiment, replacing it with any image from the "Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma"[6] paper that is most similar to our data.

### 1) JEET B. LAHIRI. "Blood Cell Segmentation Dataset." Kaggle. 2023.
A total of 2656 images are available. 1328 Original blood cell images with 1328 corresponding ground truths. Out of that, Jeet B Lahiri separated the training and testing sets with 1169 images and 159 images respectively.

#### Short Description
With the advent of deep learing algorithms in medial domain, there is a need for quality and large datasets. In this work, we introduced the largest microscopic blood cell segmentation dataset and benchmark different state-of-the-art algorithms on it. Our findings and contributions are particularly helpful for researchers working in deep learning with applications in medial domain.

### 2) Larxel. "Cancer Instance Segmentation and Classification 1,2,3" Kaggle. 2022.
This dataset, also known as PanNuke, contains semi automatically generated nuclei instance segmentation and classification images with exhaustive nuclei labels across 19 different tissue types. The dataset consists of 481 visual fields, of which 312 are randomly sampled from more than 20K whole slide images at different magnifications, from multiple data sources.
In total the dataset contains 205,343 labeled nuclei, each with an instance segmentation mask. Models trained on PanNuke can aid in whole slide image tissue type segmentation, and generalize to new tissues.

## Result

### Unet_grayscale & ResUnet_grayscale

##### Training History
Epoch : 100 , Batch : 4, Optimizer : Adam, lr = 1e-4, Augmentation : random_flip

Unet|ResUnet|
---|---|
![ex_screenshot](./image/Unet_gray.png)|![ex_screenshot](./image/ResUnet_gray.png)|

We can see in the traning history that Unet_grayscale is being overfitted. The same is true for RGB.

For ResUnet, we noticed an exploding gradient in the loss value at certain epochs. We determined that the learning rate was too high to reach a local minimum.

So we experimented by adding different models, schedulers, and early stopping.

### ResUnet, VGG11Unet, VGG16Unet, AttentionUnet + Early stoping & Learning rate scheduler 

##### Training History
Epoch : 100 , Batch : 4, Optimizer : Adam, lr = 1e-4, Augmentation : random_flip, patience = 10

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optim, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=5, min_lr=1e-6)

Overfitting occurred in all models. After adding L2-Regularization and drop out, I tried reducing the number of hidden units and layers, but the results were the same.

So we add more data. Since our task is lightweight sementic segmentation, we need to preprocess the data for instance segmentation.

The preprocessed mask is shown below.

### Additional data Unet, ResUnet, VGG11Unet, VGG16Unet, AttentionUnet + Learning rate scheduler 

##### Training History
Epoch : 50 , Batch : 4, Optimizer : Adam, lr = 1e-4, Augmentation : random_flip, patience = 10

scheduler = ReduceLROnPlateau(optim, mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=5, min_lr=1e-6)

We excluded early stopping to see the overall performance. Unet is overfitting. ResUnet suffers from gradient exploding. VGG11, VGG16, and Attention models showed ideal traning history.

We trained VGG11, VGG16, and Attention on RGB and Grayscale with early-starting and tested them on our data.

They all performed poorly on things that are difficult to distinguish with the eye.

Based on the effectiveness in removing impurities, lines and fluids, and good cell separation, attention-Unet was the best. attention-Unet performed the best.

Below is the inference of thyroid images in the paper with Attention_Unet_gray.

Additionally, we tried Meta's Segment Anything Model and it performed well, but we couldn't adopt it due to its long run time and high memory usage.
